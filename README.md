# Movie Recommendation System Data Warehouse Project

## About Files
**movie-recommend.py** - Python File to Extract Data from SQL DB, Process it and Store the Recommended Movies to BigQuery Table <br />
**movies.sql** - SQL Dataabase File<br />

## Problem Statement
The movie recommendation system is one of the most popular data warehousing project ideas. Use the movie dataset on Kaggle or any other website. Each user can add a movie to their completed list and give it a rating. The project aims to develop an effective movie recommendation system based on users' viewing history. Use the movie dataset to build a data warehouse for data analysis. Once the data has been collected and analysed, it becomes ready for building the recommendation system.

## Technology Involved
* Data Source Stored in **MySQL**
* Stored data is then processed using Python File
* Then it is further stored in Bigquery Table
